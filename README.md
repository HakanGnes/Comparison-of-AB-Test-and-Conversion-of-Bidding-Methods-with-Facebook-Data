# Comparison of AB Test and Conversion of Bidding Methods with Facebook Data

## Business Problem:
Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, "average bidding," as an alternative to the existing "maximumbidding" bidding type. One of our customers, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and wants to do an A/B test to see if averagebidding brings more conversions than maximumbidding. The A/B test has been going on for 1 month and bombabomba.com is now asking you to A/B this. It is waiting for you to analyze the results of its test. The ultimate success criterion for Bombabomba.com is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on Purchasemetrics for statistical testing.

## Dataset Story:
This data set, which includes a company's website information, includes information such as the number of advertisements that users see and click on, as well as the earnings information obtained from it. There are two separate data sets: Control and Test groups. These data sets are located on separate sheets of the ab_testing.xlsx excel. Maximum Bidding was applied to the control group and Average Bidding was applied to the test group.

## Variables:
impression: Number of ad views

Click: Number of clicks on the displayed ad

Purchase: Number of products purchased after ads clicked

Earning: Earnings earned after purchasing products
